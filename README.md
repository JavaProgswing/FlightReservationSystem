# Flight Reservation Frontend

This is the frontend application for the Flight Reservation System. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ⚠️ Important: Run the Server First

**Before using this frontend, you MUST have the backend server running.**

This frontend expects a backend API running at `http://localhost:8080`.
Please ensure the Java backend is started and listening on port 8080 before you attempt to log in or search for flights.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Start the Backend**: Ensure you have **JDK 17** installed. Run the following command from the project root (parent of `flight-frontend`):
    ```bash
    java -jar server/FlightReservationSystem-1.0.jar
    ```
2.  **Open the Frontend**:
    *   You can simply open `index.html` in your web browser.
    *   **Recommended**: Use a local static server like "Live Server" in VS Code for the best experience.
